Reaver implements a brute force attack against Wifi Protected Setup (WPS) registrar PINs in order to recover WPA/WPA2 passphrases, as described in Brute forcing Wi-Fi Protected Setup When poor design meets poor implementation. by Stefan Viehböck.
Reaver has been designed to be a robust and practical attack against Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) registrar PINs in order to recover WPA/WPA2 passphrases and has been tested against a wide variety of access points and WPS implementations.
Depending on the target's Access Point (AP), to recover the plain text WPA/WPA2 passphrase the average amount of time for the transitional online brute force method is between 4-10 hours. In practice, it will generally take half this time to guess the correct WPS pin and recover the passphrase. When using the offline attack, if the AP is vulnerable, it may take only a matter of seconds to minutes.

The first version of reaver-wps (reaver 1.0) was created by Craig Heffner in 2011.
reaver-wps-fork-t6x version 1.6.x is a community forked version which includes various bug fixes, new features and additional attack method (such as the offline Pixie Dust attack)
